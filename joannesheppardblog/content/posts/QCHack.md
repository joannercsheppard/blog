I spent a bit of time exploring Quantum Computing, which seemed like the perfect intersection of my interests in physics and software engineering. I always feel like getting hands-on, intensive experiences is way more valuable when learning about a new subject. So, to gain a better understanding of the field, I decided to participate in a Quantum Computing Hackathon, [QCHack](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/).

During the hackathon, I had the opportunity to work with IBM's Qiskit, Google's Cirq, and Microsoft's Q# to gain hands-on experience and insight into the problems and potential of the field. My team's challenge focused on reducing computational costs in deploying quantum code, which can be complex due to the specific ways in which current quantum systems are set up. In particular, not all nodes are connected, and optimizing the input of quantum gates that require multiple nodes is a significant challenge. Through our collaboration, we explored methods to optimize code input into these lattice systems.

I thoroughly enjoyed working with my team, and it was exciting to gain more knowledge in this cutting-edge field. [If you're interested in exploring our code, you can find it here](https://github.com/vasilis-stylianou/qchack).
