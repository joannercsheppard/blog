I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a Turing Data Study Group, an event that brought together some of the brightest minds from the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and beyond to tackle real-world data science challenges. The project I chose to work on aimed at detecting illegal mining activities in Myanmar, inspired by [this Global Witness report](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/myanmars-poisoned-mountains/).

Leveraging satellite imagery, our group employed various approaches to identify illicit mines. While some teams focused on classical segmentation techniques and utilized lower-quality imagery with Google Earth Engine, my subteam delved into the world of deep learning methods. We began by using high-quality images to pretrain a model capable of classifying whether a mine was present in a given image or not. Once accomplished, we shifted our attention to locating the mines using a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and another pretrained network.

The experience was nothing short of extraordinary, as we were able to learn an immense amount in just two weeks. In fact, I was so captivated by the process that I eagerly [signed up for another data study group](https://joannercsheppard.github.io/joannesheppard.io/posts/earthquakedetection/). This project reinforced my belief in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to generate meaningful and impactful solutions. As I reflect on the journey, I am not only proud of our achievements, but also deeply grateful for the opportunity to engage in such a valuable self-directed learning experience.
