I was recently assigned to an exciting new project alongside Dr. Peter Vickers. Our objective is to establish a hub-and-spoke international network, tentatively named "The Institute for Ascertaining Scientific Consensus" (IASC). With the capacity to email over 100,000 scientists, IASC aims to solicit agree/disagree responses on specific statements of interest, such as "Covid is caused by a virus." By sending emails internally within each participating institution and ensuring a minimal time demand for reading and responding, we anticipate high response rates compared to traditional scientific opinion surveys.

Responses will be instantly and anonymously recorded in a database, with the strength of consensus calculated. As humanity's premier means for measuring the strength of scientific consensus on specific statements, IASC will serve as a valuable tool for policymakers and laypersons alike. It will help combat "fake news" and misinformation while shedding light on differing expert opinions across countries or regions.

In this project, I have been tasked with front-end development and UX/UI design â€“ a first for me. It has been a thrilling experience learning new skills while contributing to such a fascinating endeavor. I've been focusing on creating a professional, interactive, and clean website that effectively communicates the project's objectives. The entire process has been incredibly enjoyable, and I'm eager to continue expanding my expertise in this area and see the impact of our work unfold.
