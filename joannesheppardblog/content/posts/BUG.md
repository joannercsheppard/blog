From November 2019 to August 2020, I had the incredible opportunity to work with some amazing minds at the [Biomedical Ultrasound Group (BUG)](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London. Dr Brad Treeby and Dr Ben Cox were my mentors during this time, and they were working on some pretty exciting stuff.

The team at BUG was exploring the possibility of using ultrasound therapy to make permanent changes to the brain without the need for invasive surgery. They were working on personalized cranial devices that could target specific regions of the brain with ultrasound, with the hope of treating issues like Parkinson's disorder. If you've ever seen videos of [patients with tremors being unable to write or hold hands with loved ones until a device is turned on and their tremors stop, then you know what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pGGGMUObQ4). The goal of BUG was to make these effects last even after the device is turned off.

My part of the project was focused on finding ways to reduce the cost of therapy. One of the major expenses was the cost of CT scans, which can run into thousands of pounds. We explored using cheaper MRI scans to create CT scans and utilize those to create therapy plans. I was able to learn PyTorch and explore neural networks for the first time during my time with the team.

While I ultimately decided not to continue with the doctoral program, I am incredibly grateful for the experience I had at BUG. I believe in their vision and hope that these personalized therapies will become accessible to more people in the near future.
