Following my highly rewarding experience at the first [Data Study Group](https://joannercsheppard.github.io/joannesheppard.io/posts/illegalmining/), I was eager to embark on yet another collaboration. This time, I joined Dr. Jamie Ward's project to explore the potential of deep learning approaches in detecting and locating earthquakes.

Throughout the project, I played a pivotal role in developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) expanding on [existing literature](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.1700578) to examine the model's robustness when applied to the California 2019 Earthquake dataset. Despite the limited time available, I managed to create and train the model on several days of data, ultimately achieving a remarkable precision of 7km in latitude and 5km in longitude.

The project's success has led to an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Jamie Ward and Dr. Andy Nowaki, as we continue to delve deeper into the fascinating world of earthquake detection and location through the power of deep learning.
